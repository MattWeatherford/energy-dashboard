# Background

The roll out of Renewable Energy (RE) is happening all over the world, and is
disrupting the energy sector. In the Western region of the USA, [California,
Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana], we have a situation where energy prices go
negative in certain areas in certain situations:

## Assertions

* In CA, the production of solar energy peaks several hours before the cooling
  systems start driving the demand, resulting in: 
  * steep demand ramp
  * need for storage
  * peak solar production is driving the energy price to zero or negative for
    that brief part of the day

* In WA, at certain times of year, our hydro systems have to run excess water
  through the turbines rather than over the spillways in order to protect the
  salmon.  This results in:
  * price of energy goes negative
  * increased maintenance costs

I have heard these assertions at energy conferences. Numerous times presenters
have shown a graph called the 'duck curve' showing how solar gain shapes solar
energy production throughout a day.

I want to prove these assertions for myself.

## Project

I started this project as a way to research better ways to move, store, and share
our energy resources. My hope is that together we can answer questions such as:

* Should we invest in X technology?
  * What are the trade-offs?
  * What will it cost?
  * How long will it take to develop?
  * What are the alternatives?
  * What are the barriers to adoption?

For example, here

### Pumped storage

Can Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) use the existing dam infrastructure
to take excess CA Solar, MT and ID wind and pump water from a lower dam to a
higher dam, and then use this water several hours later to send energy where it
is needed? What's our capacity to do this? Cost? Etc.

### Nuclear

Does it make sense to invest in Nuclear energy in this Region? Is this
appropriate for `Goal Zero` or are there better alternatives?

### Wind/Solar/Other 

There are a lot of RE options out there. Should we be investing in mega solar
and/or wind farms in this region? How much better would they be if these RE
facilities were coupled with dams equipped with pumped storage? What is the
Return on Investment (ROI) for large facilities vs. residential/municipal
rooftop installations in urban areas?

### Synthetic Fuels

There's a lot of talk about synthetic fuels, many of which are all about using
excess energy to generate hydrogen and blend that with other fuels. What are
the cost/benefits to this? 

### Battery Storage

Where does it make sense to invest in battery storage? How much does it cost,
what's their life-cycle, etc.

## Summary

I don't have answers to these questions (yet). However, being able to answer
these questions with data driven science is the goal of this project.
