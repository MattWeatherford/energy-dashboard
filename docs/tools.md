This directory contains the code for retrieving and preparing data for analytics:

* downloading raw data-sets

Code quality: all code must :

* be tested to at least 80% coverage

* be documented in `tools/readme.md`, and include example commands and
  expected results
* be added to the `tools/Makefile` targets as appropriate (build, test, etc)
