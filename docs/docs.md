# docs

This directory contains project documentation.

## Organization

For any given project, create a directory and place your documentation there:

```bash
docs/PROJECT/readme.md
```

For example, the OASIS project is:

```bash
docs/oasis/readme.md
```

Add other doc resources as necessary under the `docs/PROJECT` directory.
