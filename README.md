# Energy Dashboard

## Goal

Reverse climate change and restore our environment.

### How

Surface an _Energy Dashboard_ as a collection of Jupyter Notebooks. These
notebooks can be used to help make intelligent and informed decisions regarding
de-carbonization of the energy sector.

For about the reasons for creating this project, see:
[background](./docs/background.md)

### What is this?

This is an Open Source Project for collecting and publish energy related
datasets in one place.

#### Standardized

Because it's a standardized platform, it's easy for anyone to add a new data
set, create a new notebook, add documentation, etc.  It's all free, and it's
all standardized on...

1. Sqlite3 as the data interchange format
1. Jupyter Notebooks as the analytics platform
1. Github.com as the backing store

### Notebooks
